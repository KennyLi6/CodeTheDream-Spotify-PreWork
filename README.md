# CodeTheDream Spotify PreWork  

## Purpose  

This repository is used for the Prework section of Code The Dream.  

The application can connect to your current Spotify playback and allows you to see your
playlists linked to your account and allows you to modify your current playback.

## To Use

Contact me at kennyli3219@gmail.com with details of your Spotify 
account email so that I can add you as a authorized user in the 
Spotify Development App.

After you have been authorized, open the Github Pages deployment and allow the app to
fetch your Spotify account.  

After you have agreed, the app should load your playlists, and have a current playback
display. If you want to be able to modify your playback through the app, make sure a 
valid playback is on in the Spotify app (you may have to press play for Spotify to 
recognize the playback) and wait a few seconds for the app to check your playback.  

After the playback is recognized, you can modify your playback using the four buttons.
