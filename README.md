# CodeTheDream Spotify PreWork  

## Purpose  

This repository is used for the Prework section of Code The Dream.  

I am currently planning to use the Spotify API to display information 
such as the song I am currently listening to, playlists on my account, 
and information about favorite songs of mine.

This plan is subject to change if I learn that the Spotify API is not 
capable of certain functions.
